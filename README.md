# dyn_salt_top
a dynamic jinja top for salt, because insanity is fun.

This formula should allow for the use of a dynamic top setup. allowing for pillars to be used to direct which states a minion gets.
while this is not very useful for static pillars. this coupled with ext_pillars should offer a way to change a system in a fast pace enviroment.
allowing for servers to be setup in such a way that one can change how salt works on the fly.
